spring review and retrospective
**
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
The main focus of this program is to satisfy user needs and enhance users experiences. In order to do so, we need to create these user stories to help the team developer
evaluate and analyze each user story. This can then help everyone understand how much work will need to get these user stories done and in what order. User stories is the
best way to bridge the gap between team developers and the end users.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
While developing program, the most important agile princile to remember is to be flexible. While technology is constantly chaning, you alreays need to be adaptable. The agile process that I would like to incorporate into my future development work is the scrum methods. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development is the one who is rilable and do everything they can to help the team move forward.
